-Install git and add to the PATH to use git on command line

-Basic commands command line git:

git clone <repo> 					# Clone repository
git add . 							# Add work to commit
git commit -m <text>				# Add message to the commit
git pull origin <branch>			# Pull commit to branch. Ex: master
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>	# Create and go to new branch 
git checkout <branch_name>			# Go to branch. Ex: ., master 
git push <branch_name>				# Push content from branch


-Tips: 
(1) Plan your project and split your work in small use-cases, 
(2) Create a branch for each use-case, 
(3) pull the last version of master before start work in a branch, 
(4)Merge with master when its done, (5) Abuse of commits to have your work saved

Goal: Have always a functional version in master and allow parallell work among team mates
